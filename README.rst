|Doc Status| |Zenodo|

A fast, versatile and user-friendly landscape evolution model.

**Note: this project is currently under heavy development.**

Fastscape is a Python package that provides a lot a small model
components (i.e., processes) to use with the xarray-simlab_ modeling
framework. Those components can readily be combined together in order
to create custom Landscape Evolution Models (LEMs).

Routines from the fastscapelib_ library are used for fast model
execution.
