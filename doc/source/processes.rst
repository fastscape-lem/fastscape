Processes
=========

Fastscape provides a few dozens of processes, i.e., Python classes
decorated with :func:`xsimlab.process`, serving as building blocks for
the creation of custom landscape evolution models.

Those processes are presented by thematic below. You can import any of
them from the ``processes`` subpackage, e.g.,

.. code-block:: python

    from fastscape.processes import SurfaceTopography

Rather than building models from scratch, you might better want to
pick one of the model presets presented in the :doc:`models` section
and customize it using :meth:`xsimlab.Model.update_processes` or
:meth:`xsimlab.Model.drop_processes`.

For more help on how to use these process classes to create new
:class:`xsimlab.Model` objects, see the :doc:`examples` section or
`xarray-simlab's documentation`_.

Main interfaces & drivers
-------------------------

Defined in ``fastscape/processes/main.py``

These processes define (update them over time) the main interfaces
used in landscape evolution models, such as the topographic surface,
the bedrock level or several stratigraphic horizons.
