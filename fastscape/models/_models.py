# ``basic_model`` is a "standard" landscape evolution model that

# power law and hillslope erosion/deposition using linear
# diffusion. Initial topography is a flat surface with random

# single flow direction algorithm. All erosion processes are computed
# on a topographic surface that is first updated by tectonic forcing
# processes.

# transport and deposition. Flow is routed using a multiple flow
